### Hi there üëã

My name is Sebastian and my goal is to help developers getting better at what they're doing.

I'm a self-employed consultant, trainer, author, and conference speaker.
I wrote the book "Architecting Modern Java EE Applications", am participating in open source standardization processes, and helping forming the future standards of Enterprise Java.
Previously, I used to work for IBM as Lead Java Developer Advocate, and I've been recognized as a [Java Champion](https://dev.java/community/jcs/), Oracle Developer Champion, and JavaOne Rockstar.

Another passion of mine is the topic of developer productivity.
I'm the creator and co-founder of DayCaptain üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è (@DayCaptainApp), a developer-focused tool for prioritizing and managing one's time better.

If you're curious to what I'm doing, you can check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG21GE2Go3vkj7mrs675ysA), [Twitter @DaschnerS](https://twitter.com/DaschnerS), [blog](https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com), and [podcast](https://anchor.fm/effective-developer).
